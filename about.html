			<p> hola </p>

			<p> I just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, wherein<a href="http://nonchee.github.com/resume"> quite a lot went down</a>. I shall salute the friends I made while there and abroad in Budapest. 
			</p>


			<p>	And next I'll be working as a software engineer at Audible. 
			</p>

			<p> Until then, here are a few of my current favorite words:

				<div class="coming-soon">images of each with accompanying pronancyation</div>

				
				<p>
					english: brine, strudel, lobster, bread, McCann (that's someone's name, courtesy of my pal Dan, who likely hasn't seen this. hi dan!) 

		         <p> french: oh la-la-la-la (to mean heightened irritation), oh la-la-la-la-la-la (hands in head, to mean utter despair)
				</p>
				<p class="thumb-tag"> *(interestingly french is the only language i actually am trying to learn right now but you wouldn't be able to tell from this list) </p>


				<p> chinese: orange chicken </p>
				<p class="thumb-tag"> **(i also speak chinese) </p>

				<p>
				spanish: una mujer!! (the only word i know in this language)
				</p>

				<p>
				greek: <span class="coming-soon">ble</span> (blue! bleh-berries!)
		 		</p>

				<p>
				hungarian: nincs, and the ability to add -izik to anything to make it a verb
				</p>

				<p>
